        <p class="box">I am a computer programmer in Ridgway, Colorado with a wide variety of interests and a passion for learning.
            I am most fluent with Java, Python, and C++, and enjoy mastering new languages.
            I am currently learning at New College of Florida, and have 4 years of programming experience.
            I have also worked for Coding with Kids, a summer programming camp, as a teacher, growing my communication skills alongside valuable work experience.
            You can check out my latest educational endeavors in the Projects tab.
            talk about travel since I do that a lot, talk about summer villages
