    To Do list:
    dotted lines, but not just the table lines - done
    color scheme:
    dark grey, light grey, white text and dotted lines, blue or purple?
    I pretty much just want this format:
    text | text
    -----------
    text | text
    -----------
    text | text
    -----------
    text | text
    figure out how to make it work for mobile/small monitor through the text moving underneath under certain screen width.
    Use table to split the site in half X use div instead
    currently it resizes, which is not too bad but will become a problem with more content
    icon top middle?
    eventually split css from the html and use link - done
    favicon
    update information, really make sure it is as correct as possible
    align top middle instead of just middle
    lots and lots of formatting, come up with a text style and color scheme & learn how to apply it to the whole page
 No Longer using tables
    figure out how to set up custom table names for the CSS X
    add table headers for the head sections X
    custom dashes for the table X

    Do I want to get the text in and then go bottom up or top down?


Round 2:

    swap for div instead of tables, easier to use for layout - Done
    Set up styles in the CSS file
    How to let div box line up next to each other
