<!--
    To Do list:
    dotted lines, but not just the table lines
    color scheme:
    dark grey, light grey, white text and dotted lines, blue or purple?
    figure out how to make it work for mobile/small monitor through the text moving underneath under certain screen width.
    Use table to split the site in half
    currently it resizes, which is not too bad but will become a problem with more content
    icon top middle?
    eventually split css from the html and use link
    favicon
    update information, really make sure it is as correct as possible
    align top middle instead of just middle
    lots and lots of formatting, come up with a text style and color scheme & learn how to apply it to the whole page
