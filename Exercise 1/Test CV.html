<!--
    Important notes: 
    style cannot work without it modifying something, ie I cant just style the background color.
    You can modify a tag by using the style tag in the head and defining another tag.
    text does not automatically go to the next line in a paragraph, even if it does in the code. needs <br>
    seems to automatically fill the whole page if it can.
    apperently the stuff I am doing in head is CSS. good to know.
    scroll will activate automatically if I have enough lines. probably can manipulate this with image size.
    If I use pre, I need to have it start in the same spot as I want on the website, as it copies exactly.
    make the website 
    borders need to be solid

            Overarching plan:
            top of page will have clickable buttons that scroll to info
            Consice
            background image?
            color theme?
            dotted lines for breaking up page
            for now pretty much copy paste from my website, then update info.
